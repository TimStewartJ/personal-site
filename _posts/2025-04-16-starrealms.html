<h1>Star Realms - Skill or Luck?</h1>

<p class="desc">Creating a machine learning AI to play Star Realms.</p>
<p>
    Star Realms is a deck-building game that combines elements of strategy and luck. Players build their decks by acquiring cards from a central trade row, and
    the goal is to reduce your opponent's authority (health) to zero. Players must carefully manage their resources and make strategic decisions to outmaneuver their opponents.
