    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to this website, I host and maintain another website, Discord bot, and some game servers. Previously, I would run it all manually on
      an old laptop sitting by a router under my desk. Any updates I wanted to make would require me ssh'ing in, running `git pull`, and then
      performing whatever other steps would be necessary to get the service running. Setting up and configuring NGINX for multiple domains was simple
      enough at first, but any time I needed to make changes or view my settings required me digging through `/etc` with many executions of `cat` and
      `ls`.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, the setup, while I was proud of it for figuring it out on my own, just felt clunky and unsustainable. Clearly, something new was
      needed.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Enter Docker. Now, I don't need to fret over if I need to re-run `npm install` or worry about a million python virtual environments and how to
      make all of them coexist peacefully. No, all I would need to do is run a few Docker commands and my service would be up and running! Just like
      that! I so desperately wish I learned to apply Docker in my personal servers sooner. It's absolutely amazing and I wish for anyone doing any
      sort of dev-ops to try it out.
    </p>

    <h2>The Setup</h2>
    <p>
      For my websites, I now have each running in its own Docker container with a specific port exposed. Then, in the same environment, I have
      <a href="https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy">nginx-proxy</a> and its
      <a href="https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion">acme companion</a> running in their own Docker containers. They both handle literally
      all of the ingress (with free SSL!) and it is truly joyous how it takes just a few commands to set that up. The Discord bot also resides in its
      own container that sets up the Node.js environment and runs the bot with pm2 to allow for automatic restarts in the event it crashes.
    </p>

    <h2>The Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Use Docker for anything hosted to hold onto sanity for just a little longer.</p>
