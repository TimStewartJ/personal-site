            and site reliability engineer at Libretexts. My interests include the following:
			<ul>
				<li>coding</li>
				<li>video games</li>
				<li>mechanical keyboards</li>
				<li>electric skateboards</li>
				<li>pc building</li>

        <h2>About the site</h2>
        <p>
            You can find things that I'm working on, that I've done, and my
            resume on this site. I try my best to keep it up to date, but it may
            be a bit behind what I'm actually up to.

            While it may not seem like much, it's enough for me to call home :)
